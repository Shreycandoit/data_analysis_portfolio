# [Project 1: Movie Correlation Project](https://github.com/Shreycandoit/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS-main/moviecorrelationproject.ipynb)

This project was done on Jupyter Notebook, mainly based on Python. In this project, I've found some correlations between different fields of the given dataset.

* Data was taken from the movie dataset.
* The dataset: [movies.csv.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10474382/movies.csv.zip)
* The project is mainly based on pandas(for data cleaning), numpy(for statistics), seaborn and matplotlib(for data visualization).
* Some of the visualizations from the project:

# [Project 2: Major Project-Covid-19](https://github.com/Shreycandoit/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS-main/Major%20Project-Covid-19)
You can download the required dataset from the following website-> [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## [File 1: Data Cleaning by python- covid-data-cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/Shreycandoit/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS-main/Major%20Project-Covid-19/Covid-data-cleaning.ipynb) 

* In this file, I've dropped some unnecessary fields from the .csv file by using pandas.
* Divided the original dataset into two .csv files:
1. CovidDeaths.csv
2. CovidVaccinations.csv

You can find these datasets here- [Divided covid datasets.zip](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476401/Divided.covid.datasets.zip).

Since I love python, I used Jupyter Notebook here. You can directly execute this step using MS-Excel.

## [File 2: Data Cleaning by MySQL- COVID PORTFOLIO PROJECT.sql](https://github.com/Shreycandoit/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS-main/Major%20Project-Covid-19/COVID%20PORTFOLIO%20PROJECT.sql)

* Performed some basic operations and functions so that data can be easily explored and visualized by Tableau.
* Extracted 4 sub .csv files 
1. [Table1_GlobalNumbers.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476352/Table1_GlobalNumbers.csv),
2. [Table2_DeathsInContinent.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476355/Table2_DeathsInContinent.csv),
3. [Table3_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulation.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476354/Table3_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulation.csv) and
4. [Table4_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulationpt2.csv](https://github.com/iamdevanshuguptaa/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476359/Table4_HighestInfectionRateComparedPopulationpt2.csv)

* By using the 4 csv files extracted by SQL, I've visualized them on a single dashboard. Explore and play around with it.
Thank you!
* Glimpse to that dashboard->

# [Project 3: Data cleaning using MySQL- Nashville Housing Data](https://github.com/Shreycandoit/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS-main/blob/main/nashvilleDataCleaning.sql)

* Dataset: [Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx.zip](https://github.com/Shreycandoit/data_analysis_portfolio/tree/main/PORTFOLIOPROJECTS/files/10476525/Nashville.Housing.Data.for.Data.Cleaning.xlsx.zip)
* Cleaned this dataset by using MySQL.
* Used CTE's.
* Atlast, deleted unused columns in the given dataset.
